                <p>The Maldives is a nation of coral islands scattered across the Indian Ocean. The Maldivian
                    archipelago consists of about 1190 small low-lying coral islands of which few of them are, just a
                    meter above sea level. These islands stretch more than 800 km from north to south covering a total
                    area of about 90,000 square km of which about 99% is water. Maldivian economy was traditionally
                    based on fisheries till the emergence of tourism as its foreign currency generator in the late 20th
                    century.</p>

                                Plugs are either the 3 square pin - 13 amp British type or they are the 2-pin European
                                style. If you are used to a 110V supply you will need a small transformer to convert
                                from 240V to 110V.</p>

                            <h2>How to Dive the Maldives – Liveaboards</h2>

                            <p>Because many of the dive sites and atolls in the Maldives are remote and away from the
                                resorts the best way to access this world class destination is on a Maldives Liveaboard
                                safari. Liveaboard operators offering diving cruises throughout the archipelago abide by
                                strict safety standards, are budget to luxury class, and are well equipped for oceanic
                                voyages.</p>

                            <p>Cruises will vary in length from 7 to 11 days to a huge variety of islands and dive sites
                                where the big pelagic’s are always in attendance. Check out our individual liveaboard
                                options for more complete and detailed information on diving throughout the
                                Maldives.</p>

                            <p><span class="redbold">Please note that space on quality liveaboards is limited and booking well in advance is necessary to guarantee your requested dates!</span>

                            <p>Known as the "Pearl of the Indian Ocean" the Maldives lie on the equator southwest of Sri
                                Lanka and India. An archipelago of 26 major atolls and 1,190 coral reef islands
                                stretching over 800 km from north to south and over 100 km from east to west. Only 200
                                of these islands are inhabited and nearly a half of these have been developed as
                                exclusive resorts.</p>

                            <h2>Getting to the Maldives</h2>

                            <p>Male International Airport (IATA: MLE, ICAO: VRMM) is the main international airport in
                                the Maldives. It is located on Hulhule Island in the North Male Atoll, near the capital
                                island of Male. There are many direct international flights into Male from Europe, Asia,
                                and the U.S., making the Maldives a very easy destination to travel to. </p>

                            <p>Most Maldives liveaboard trips will depart directly from Hulhule Harbor, where the
                                airport is located. However; for liveaboard trips to the northern or southern atolls an
                                additional domestic or sea plane flight may be required. Depending on the liveaboard
                                trip selected a one way domestic flight from Male to the departure point or a round trip
                                domestic flight from Male to the departure point may be required. <a href="">Contact
                                    us </a>for departure point details.</p>

                            <p>On the day of liveaboard departure there will be transfer service provided to and from
                                your liveaboard and the airport in the Maldives. After arriving you will be greeted at
                                the airport and transferred to the boat, its that easy! Most liveaboards will arrange a
                                transfer time that is shortly after lunch on the day of departure. It is best to arrange
                                a flight into the Maldives that arrives before lunch. There are day rooms that can be
                                booked at the Hulhule Airport Hotel if you arrive into the Maldives in the early morning
                                and need a place to relax before the trip.</p>

                            <p>If you overnight in Male the night prior to departure you will need to make your way back
                                to the airport at the designated time for your pick up and transfer. The pick up
                                location for all Maldives liveaboard departures is the airport.</p>

                            <p class="navy-blue">Please note that to enter the Maldives you must have a minimum of 6
                                months before expiration left on your passport and one full clean page for your visa on
                                arrival.</p>

                            <p class="red-bold">Dive Adventures Asia recommends that when you travel to Maldives you
                                incorporate two extra hotel nights into your travel plans. One hotel night on arrival
                                between the international and domestic flights, and one hotel night on your journey home
                                between the domestic and international flights. This advice will be greatly appreciated
                                should there be a flight delay, cancellation, schedule change, baggage delay, or loss of
                                baggage. If you choose to ignore this recommendation Dive Adventures Asia cannot be held
                                responsible for any loss as a result of the aforementioned.</p>

                            <p class="red-bold">We recommend that you also purchase travel insurance. In the unlikely
                                event that you are unable to make the trip or there is an unexpected event you will be
                                able to recover your deposit or payment. <span class="important">THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!</span>
